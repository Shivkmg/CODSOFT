                <h3>Project 1:- TIC-TAC-TOE GAME</h3>
                <p>This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game using C++. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The game checks for win conditions after each move, including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. If a player successfully aligns three of their symbols, they win the game. If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game results in a draw. The program uses simple text-based input and output for interaction with the players.

                <h3>Project 2:- NUMBER GUESSING GAME</h3>
                <p>This project implements a Number Guessing Game using C++. The program randomly generates a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player tries to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The player continues to guess until they find the correct number. The program also keeps track of the number of attempts taken by the player and displays it at the end of the game.
